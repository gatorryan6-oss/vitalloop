# Build log — VITAL LOOP

Single source of truth for project state. Newest entry at the top of the
Milestones section. Claude Code: read this whole file at session start; append
an entry at the end of every milestone. Never delete or rewrite old entries.

Entry format:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD — M[n]: [milestone name]
- Shipped: [what now works, one or two lines]
- Deferred: [anything pushed to later, with the milestone it moved to]
- Open bugs: [anything known-broken, even if minor]
- Decisions: [any design/architecture choice made mid-milestone]
```

## Current state

- **Committed:** M0. Phase 1 spec is `vital_loop_v1_kickoff.md` (M0–M5).
- **Next up:** M1 — the thermoregulation engine (`engine/sim.py`) built to
  the API contract in `tests/test_invariants.py`'s docstring, plus
  `python -m engine.demo` (cold-room story as a console table).
- **Port:** 5083 (this project's own; see CLAUDE.md for the machine registry).
- **Open bugs:** none.
- **Standing caution:** the invariants file froze the history record fields
  (kickoff §5) and the engine API before M1 exists. If M1's physiology
  genuinely can't satisfy a pinned behavior (e.g. monotone cooling with
  effectors off), show the human the conflict — don't loosen the test
  silently.
