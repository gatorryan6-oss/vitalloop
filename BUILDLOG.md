# Build log — VITAL LOOP

Single source of truth for project state. Newest entry at the top of the
Milestones section. Claude Code: read this whole file at session start; append
an entry at the end of every milestone. Never delete or rewrite old entries.

Entry format:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD — M[n]: [milestone name]
- Shipped: [what now works, one or two lines]
- Deferred: [anything pushed to later, with the milestone it moved to]
- Open bugs: [anything known-broken, even if minor]
- Decisions: [any design/architecture choice made mid-milestone]
```

## Current state

- **Committed:** M2. Phase 1 spec is `vital_loop_v1_kickoff.md` (M0–M5).
- **Next up:** M3 — disturbance controls: env-temp slider (−10…45),
  exercise toggle, scenario buttons, plus a third chart panel for effector
  activity (sweat/shiver/vaso).
- **Port:** 5083 (this project's own; see CLAUDE.md for the machine registry).
- **Open bugs:** none.
- **Standing caution:** the invariants file froze the history record fields
  (kickoff §5) and the engine API before M1 exists. If M1's physiology
  genuinely can't satisfy a pinned behavior (e.g. monotone cooling with
  effectors off), show the human the conflict — don't loosen the test
  silently.

## Milestones

## 2026-08-13 — M2: Flask app with live strip charts
- Shipped: `app.py` (lazy-ticking runner — engine steps on each poll by
  wall-time × speed, capped catch-up; `/state` since-param JSON;
  `/control` pause/resume/reset/speed), page with core-temp and environment
  strip charts (SVG, dataviz-palette colors, crosshair tooltip), big
  classroom readouts. verify.py now a real end-to-end check incl. `/state`.
  Controls exercised live in the browser: 16× ≈ 32 sim-s per 2 wall-s,
  pause freezes clock, reset clears client buffer, bad speed → 400.
- Deferred: nothing.
- Open bugs: none.
- Decisions: no background thread — determinism and un-wedgeability beat
  smoothness we don't need at 4 Hz polling. Reset keeps the current speed
  setting on purpose. Chart y-ranges fixed (core 33–41, env −15–45) so
  vertical position stays trustworthy across a lesson.

## 2026-08-13 — M1: Thermoregulation engine + console demo
- Shipped: `engine/sim.py` (heat-budget model + proportional hypothalamus,
  frozen history records) and `python -m engine.demo` (cold-snap story:
  dip → vasoconstriction → shiver → recovery). All 11 invariants pass.
- Deferred: nothing.
- Open bugs: none. (One caught pre-commit: demo's cold snap at t=300 never
  fired because the loop stepped in 120 s chunks — trigger must sit on a
  chunk boundary; comment added.)
- Decisions: proportional-only control, so the loop holds a small honest
  steady-state error (~0.15 °C at 5 °C ambient) rather than snapping exactly
  to 37 — kept deliberately, it's real physiology and visible in the data.
  Constants sized for a ~70 kg adult (100 W basal, 245 kJ/°C, sweat max
  650 W, shiver max 300 W).

## 2026-08-13 — M0: Repo scaffolding
- Shipped: standing kit configured (port 5083, marker "Vital Loop");
  `tests/test_invariants.py` pins kickoff §2/§5 AND freezes the M1 engine
  API contract in its docstring. Venv created, git repo, first commit.
- Deferred: nothing.
- Open bugs: none.
- Decisions: engine API + history record fields frozen before the engine
  exists, so tests are the contract, not an afterthought.
